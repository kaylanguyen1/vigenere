What I know about the project
        -  I need to make 3 files: 1) a logger which will log stdin; 2) an encryption program that will accept commands in the form YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM [ACTION] MESSAGE and execute them (pass, encrypt, decrypt, quit, result) or raise an error; 3) a driver program which will ask for the input, create two new processes for executing the logger and encryption program, and print a menu that the user can choose from (password, encrypt, decrypt, history, quit)
    My plan:
        I plan to first work on the driver program to ensure I'm able to create the two new processes that will be used for the logger and encryption files. From there, I plan to create the logger file then the encryption file.
